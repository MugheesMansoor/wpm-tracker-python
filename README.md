# Interactive Typing Speed Test in Terminal (Python + Curses)
               This project is a beginner-friendly Typing Speed Test built entirely in Python using the powerful curses library. It runs directly in the Command Prompt and provides an interactive, real-time typing experience. The program displays randomly generated text, tracks user input, calculates Words Per Minute (WPM), and measures typing accuracy. With its clean terminal UI, responsive feedback, and curses-based keyboard handling, this project is an excellent introduction to Python, terminal applications, and performance-based user interaction.
